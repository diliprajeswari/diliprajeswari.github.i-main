            I’m the co-founder & CTO of LightHearted AI. We aim to prevent 10
            million heart-related deaths by 2030.
        </p>
        <p>
            At LightHearted, we have developed a laser-based stethoscope that
            uses light to acquire never-before-captured digital biomarkers of
            the heart sounds of the patient from several meters distance. This
            enables us to cheaply, non-invasively, and accurately diagnose
            cardiovascular conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have already run 2 pilot studies, and have published a patent and
            several articles.

                >We are currently running a clinical trial at Queen Elizabeth
                University Hospital in Glasgow using a £1M grant that was won
                for the project</a

            Precision Medicine has captivated my imagination since I was 15. We
            have dynamic personalised movie recommendations for entertainment,
            but when it comes to Healthcare, it’s mostly been passive with
            treatments based on trial & error. I have dedicated over five years
            to developing clinical-grade precision medicine platforms - from
            neurosurgery tools to personalised treatment recommendation
            solutions - demonstrating my commitment to advancing medical
            technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            1 in 3 will die of cardiovascular disease, with the illness costing
            the global healthcare systems over $100B annually. In the UK alone,
            the urgency of the situation is highlighted by the 100,000 annual
            emergency admissions in life-or-death scenarios, despite evidence
            that community-level diagnostics could prevent premature deaths and
            improve quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our innovative solution enables early and remote detection of heart
            disease patients, facilitating timely intervention through
            pharmaceutical treatments and lifestyle modifications. Our device is
            designed with the vision of seamless integration into multifaceted
            health monitoring systems, enhancing its utility in both clinical
            and home settings, further enabling Precision Medicine and
            Preventative Healthcare for a globally ageing population.
